    <Title>XR Project Week 1 "Getting inspired"</Title>
   <Text>
       <p>During this week the team focused entirely on brain storming. We discussed different fun ideas, mechanics,
        story naratives and functionalites that would be fun to have. However, one thing was for sure, we were going to 
        make a game in VR.</p>
        <p>The team discussed several different paths to take. At the end we were left to choose from the following options:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                "Split"
                <Text> A game where you you need to survive a zombie outbreak in the metro of NYC. However in a world 
                    overrun by zombies you need a companion or several. The idea was that the game would try to simulate a split personality, where by using 
                    spatial audio, sounds are played from different points around you. Those sounds are your other personalities trying to warn of approching enemies and guide you though the map.</Text>
                
            </li>
            <li>
                "Spiderman+The floor is lava +You're in space"
                <Text>
                    A game where you are stranded on a lava planet in space where enemies are continously trying to kill you while you have nothing to defend yourself
                    but a gun and some spidermen webbing tech.

            </li>
        </ol>
        <Text>Although the incredibly fun narrative of simulating a split personality, the childish element of wanting to be 
            a superhero took over and the team decided it would be much more entertaining to create an environment where one has the power of spiderman.
