    <Title>VR Week 1 - Setting up VR</Title>
    <Text>
        Setting up the VR project and trying out the VR interaction toolkit.
        The team explored the various different functionality provided by the interaction toolkit. 
        Such as the following:
        <ol>
            <li>Locomotion System</li>
            <li>Continous Turn Provider </li>
            <li>Continous Move Provider</li>
        </ol>
        We even created one of our own:
        <ol>
            <li>Continous Flight Prrovider</li>
        </ol>
        This gave an overall understanding of of some of the key features of navigating oneself within the VR World.

    <h2>Ideas</h2>
    <Text>Once famirialized with the above, we set on to find an adequate idea for our project.</Text>
    We discussed the following:
    <ol>
        <li>The infinite corridor</li>
        <Text>An endless library in which you store your memories, or in non-fantasy terms, a library where you may store
            all your notes and relevant documents. </Text>
            <li>Puzzle Prison</li>
            <Text>A series of challenges where the player must solve lazer puzzles that are increasing in complexity in order to escape from prison.</Text>
            <li>Minecraft VR</li>
            <Text>A game where you have the power of god. You create and you destroy, you shape the world in your image and you reign anhialation on it.
                All in the simple form of blocks.
            </Text>
        
    </ol>
    <h2>Conclusion on Idea</h2>
    <Text>After much discussion the team decided to go with "Minecraft VR" due to our mutual love for the game.</Text>
